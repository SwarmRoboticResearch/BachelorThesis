BachelorThesis:Distributed, scalable algorithmic methods for swarms with multiple leader robots
==============


In this bachelor thesis, we examine a scalable and distributed method to control and
maintain large swarms of robots. In an attempt to find a balance between local and global
swarm manipulation strategies, independent, externally controlled leader robots are used to
influence the shape and movement of a swarm. Particular focus is put on the distributed
management of swarm connectivity in the face of multiple simultaneous robot failures.
Steiner-tree approximations are formed between the leader robots to pursue the antago-
nistic goals of control and connectivity. A simulator is developed to allow for simulated
experiments to verify the feasibility of the proposed methods and an intuitive understand-
ing of the swarm algorithms by its extensive visual analysis capabilities.

*This thesis was made with the time constraint of three months and thus is not perfect. However, it builds the fundament of further research. E.g. there will be a paper at the EuroCG2015 that uses methods from this thesis but also eliminates some shortcomings of it.*
